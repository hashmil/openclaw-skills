# City Guide Skill

> **⚠️ API Key Required:** This skill requires the `goplaces` skill and a Google Places API key. 
> Set up `goplaces` first and configure your API key via `goplaces auth` or environment variable.

Manage your personal city database — log places, get smart recommendations based on weather and vibe, and track your visits. Works for **any city worldwide**.

## Data Source
- **File:** `memory/city-tracker.json`
- **Helper:** `goplaces` CLI (for fetching address, rating, location data)

## First-Time Setup

If `memory/city-tracker.json` doesn't exist, the skill will create it with this structure:

```json
{
  "city": "Your City Name",
  "places": []
}
```

## Actions

### 1. Set Your City
**Trigger:** "Set city to [City Name]", "I'm in [City]", "Change city to [City]"
**Procedure:**
1. Create `memory/city-tracker.json` if it doesn't exist
2. Set the `city` field to the user's city
3. Confirm: "City set to [City]. Ready to log places!"

### 2. Log a New Place
**Trigger:** "Log [Place Name]", "I went to [Place]", "Add [Place]"
**Procedure:**
1. **Check City:** Ensure `memory/city-tracker.json` exists and has a city set. If not, ask the user to set their city first.
2. **Search:** Run `goplaces search "[Place Name] [City Name]" --limit 1 --json`.
3. **Verify:** Check if the result matches the user's intent.
4. **Read DB:** Read `memory/city-tracker.json`.
5. **Append:** Add a new entry to the `places` array using the **Schema** below.
    *   *Auto-fill:* Name, Google Place ID, Details (rating, address), Location.
    *   *Infer:* Area (from address), Type (from `types`), Environment (Indoor/Outdoor based on type/photos if available, or ask user).
    *   *Ask User:* specific notes, "Good for what weather?" (rain, snow, heat, etc.), "Vibe".
5. **Save:** Write back to `memory/city-tracker.json`.

### 3. Log a Repeat Visit
**Trigger:** "We went back to [Place]", "Visited [Place] again"
**Procedure:**
1. **Find:** Locate the place in `memory/city-tracker.json`.
2. **Update:** Add a new object to the `visits` array with `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `notes`.

### 4. Recommend
**Trigger:** "Where should I go?", "Suggest a place for [activity]", "Dinner spot?", "It's raining, where's good?"
**Procedure:**
1. **Analyze Context:**
    *   **Weather:** Ask or infer current conditions — hot, cold, rainy, snowy, humid, windy?
    *   **Vibe:** Chill, fancy, work, kids?
2. **Filter DB:** Query `memory/city-tracker.json` based on weather:
    *   *If raining/snowy:* Filter for `environment: "Indoor"` or `seasonality` includes "Rainy" or "Snowy".
    *   *If hot/sunny:* Filter for `environment: "Indoor"` or `seasonality` includes "Sunny" or "Hot Weather".
    *   *If cold but clear:* Prefer `environment: "Outdoor"` with `seasonality: "Cold Weather"` or "All Year".
    *   *If perfect weather:* Prioritize `environment: "Outdoor"` or "Hybrid".
3. **Vibe Check (Consensus Search):**
    *   For the top candidate, run multiple targeted searches across different platforms:
        *   **Reddit:** "[Place] [City] reddit review tips"
        *   **Twitter/X:** "[Place] [City] twitter review experience"
        *   **TripAdvisor:** "[Place] [City] tripadvisor review"
        *   **Google Reviews:** "[Place] [City] google reviews recent"
        *   **Blogs:** "[Place] [City] blog review 2026"
    *   Look for: Parking chaos, best arrival times, hidden gems, "tourist trap" warnings, crowd levels, and recent experiences.
4. **Output:** Present 3 top options with their status (Visited/Wishlist) and a **"Pro Tip"** derived from the search.
